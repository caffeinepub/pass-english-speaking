  "summary": "The BuildRequest contains constraints about keeping News in demo mode and ensuring no frontend API key handling, but the only change is to `project_state.json`, adding/updating a project summary and feature list describing a mobile app UI, News regions content, and even \"GNews-backed\" refresh behavior. No concrete implementation evidence is present, but the modified state file introduces multiple unrequested features and requirements metadata not present in the BuildRequest.",
