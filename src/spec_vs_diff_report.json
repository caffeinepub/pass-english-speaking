  "summary": "Implemented: global Poppins typography, vibrant glassmorphism Home dashboard with emoji buttons, new bottom-fixed large mic control component, and Day1 test result confetti/shake effects. Not fully evidenced: UPSC Interview 'Listening...' wave animation + live transcript chat bubble, and explicit 'Speak' control UI state. Diff also includes several unrequested news/backend-typing related changes.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Show a visible 'Listening...' state with animated wave effect near the mic, and show live speech-to-text in a chat-bubble element with interim updates; errors should toast and return UI to inactive.",
      "reason": "The new BottomMicControl shows a status pill ('Recording Active') and a mic button, but no 'Listening...' label, wave animation UI, or chat-bubble transcript UI is evidenced in the provided diffs. ProAIInterviewerPage stores interimTranscript, but the UI rendering of a chat bubble and wave animation is not shown in the truncated diff.",

      "requirement": "Add a clearly labeled 'Speak' (or 'Speak Question') control on the interview step to play the current question via existing TTS utilities, reflecting speaking state without hiding the mic.",
      "reason": "ProAIInterviewerPage imports speakText/stopSpeaking and has isSpeaking state, but the diff excerpt does not show any rendered button/control labeled 'Speak' or 'Speak Question', nor the UI state changes during playback.",
